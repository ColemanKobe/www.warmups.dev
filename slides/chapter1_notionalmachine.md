# What happens when a Python program runs?

Notes: ðŸ¤¯ Along with understanding the parts of a Python program, you need to
understand what happens when a specific line of code in the program runs. This
part of the warmup leverages the ideas in a book, called <a href =
"http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html">Teaching Tech Together</a>, to develop
a *notion* about what happens when a Python program executes on a computer.
Don't forget that a notion is a belief or conception about something. Now, you
are going to learn a *notional machine* for Python. I know, it sounds strange,
but it's simply a way to understand a program's behavior!

# Calculating the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers

```python
# create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]
# add the numbers together
s = sum(numbers)
# count the values in numbers
N = len(numbers)
# compute the arithmetic mean
mean = s / N
# display the arithmetic mean
print(f"Mean: {mean}")
```

```out
Mean: 4.0
```

- **Variables**: `numbers`, `s`, `N`, and `mean`
- **Functions**: `sum`, `len`, and `print`
- **Comments**: `# create a list of numbers`
- When a developer runs this Python program, it produces output
- Okay, try to answer these questions:
  - What is the purpose of a variable?
  - What is the output produced by this program?
  - What are the input(s), output(s), and behavior of functions like `sum`,
  `len`, and `print`?

Notes: ðŸ¤© This Python program calculates the arithmetic mean, or the average, of
a list of numbers. Without getting caught up in the details, can you determine
the purpose of each line of source code? Go ahead, say your guess out loud!
