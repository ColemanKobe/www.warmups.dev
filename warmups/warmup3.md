<exercise id="1" title="Input and Display a File">

- Using the following source code, can you find these parts of a program?
  - User-defined function:
      - Name: `read`
      - Input: `file_name`
      - Output: `file_text`
      - Body: three comments and three statements
  - User-defined function:
      - Name: `display`
      - Input: `contents`
      - Output: `None`
      - Body: two comments and two statements
- The `contents` variable is also called the parameter to the `display` function
- Note that the `display` function produces output but does not `return` a value
- Complete the task near each `TODO` marker and remove the `TODO` when finished
