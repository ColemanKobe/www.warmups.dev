<exercise id="2" title="Components of a Python program">

Using the previous source code as an example, what can you find in a Python program?

<choice>

<opt text="Variables that provide a human-readable reminder of the code's behavior">

Nope, variables store values on behalf of the Python program.

</opt>

<opt text="Variables that store values used for the Python program's computation" correct="true">

Yep, variables store values that can then be used in a computation.

</opt>

<opt text="Comments with values that the Python program displays in its output">

Nope, comments are human-readable reminders of the code's behavior.

</opt>

<exercise id="3" title="Modifying a Python Program">

- You can edit and run this program in your web browser! ðŸ’¯
- The first time you click "Run Code" it may take 60 seconds to run
- Don't worry, every other run will be much faster
- The program should produce the output `Mean: 5.0`

<codeblock id="01_03">

- Fill in the `_` in `numbers = [_, _, _, _]` to make a new list of values
- Fill in the `_` in `mean = _ / _` to compute the arithmetic mean
- Don't forget that the program must produce the output of `Mean: 20`

</codeblock>
